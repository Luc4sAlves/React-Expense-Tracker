This Expense Tracker is a personal React project I'm doing as a way to showcase/practice some of the skills I have.

In it, you can make lists (that currently represents months) and add expenses to a table, counting your monthly expenses. You can also set a total budget for each month, and the program even has small visual cues to warn the user when the total month expenses get too close to the total budget.

Even though this project is just a skill showcase, I'm still making it to be useful, and even plan to use it myself when it gets close to done.
